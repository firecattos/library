# Library

[Live preview](https://firecattos.github.io/library/)

This project was created as part of The Odin Project course, and although it was developed intermittently provided a great opportunity to approach the world of the modals and their functionality.

It allowed me to apply my knowledge of arrays, objects, pointers and their properties, while also introducing me to dataset properties.

Additionally, it gave me a practical way to better understand the differences between percentages and specific units, like "vh".
